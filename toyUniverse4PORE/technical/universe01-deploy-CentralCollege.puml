#### 1.1.2 Central College (Outsourced approach)

- Contracts with Big Box for IdP services
- Contracts with Learnings R Us for:
  - LMS platform
  - Authorization server
  - Credential issuance (diplomas/transcripts as VCs)
  - Portal services
- No self-hosted technical resources

### 1.2 Service Providers

#### 1.2.1 Learnings R Us

- Provides LMS to both Eastern and Central
- Provides authorization server to Central College
- Issues credentials on behalf of Central College
- Issues class badges (used by Eastern)
- Provides portal service to Central College
- Issues CAN_ACCESS tokens for journal resources

### 2.2 Central College Interactions

Central College demonstrates an outsourced identity and access management approach:

1. **Delegated Identity Management**:
   - Authentication happens via Big Box IdP
   - Authorization decisions delegated to Learning R Us
   - Clear separation between authentication and authorization

2. **Service Consumption**:
   - Central College users access resources through delegated services
   - Learning R Us acts as Central's representative for most services
   - Resource access governed by contractual relationships

3. **Resource Access**:
   - Central's library can access Woodworking Guild journal
   - Subscription validation through proper authorization tokens
   - Tokens issued by Learning R Us's authorization server
